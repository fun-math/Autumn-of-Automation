For the beginner's assignment the results are 
train_acc=100%
valid_acc=99.8%
test_acc=99%
precision=recall=98.96%

For the advanced assignment, the model (till now) is indeed producing decent results for direction and sunglasses detection (96% and 99% validation accuracy) but fails badly for emotion detection (16% validation accuracy xD).
